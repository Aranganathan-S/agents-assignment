# 🎭 Echo — Multi-Modal, Multi-Agent Voice Storyteller

Echo is a real-time, multi-modal voice assistant built on the LiveKit Agents SDK. It uses a structured, state-driven, multi-agent design that smoothly shifts from an information-gathering phase into a creative storytelling phase, powered by a modern AI stack.

This project demonstrates custom interruption handling, intelligent turn detection, and seamless agent handoff to deliver a natural and engaging voice experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Agent Flow Control**  
  Uses a state-machine-based handoff to move from the `IntroAgent` (user data capture) to the `StoryAgent` (personalized narrative generation) without breaking conversation flow.

- **Smart Turn Detection**  
  - **Filler Filtering:** Ignores casual backchannel words like *“yeah”* and *“ok”* so the agent doesn’t lose momentum.  
  - **Priority Commands:** Instantly responds to hard commands such as *“STOP”* or *“PAUSE”* through a custom transcript listener.

- **Dynamic Personalization**  
  Collects user details like name and location to generate unique, real-time, customized stories.

- **Automated Session Cleanup**  
  Automatically shuts down resources and removes the LiveKit room once a session ends.
